# another_framework
Just another sass -> css framework, just to prove how unnecessary it is. Let's face it, there's no point, but i did it anyway.


##Framework (new ones) do not solve different problems
This is example of some sass mixins which allow to generate grid and other media query dependand classes.

Treat this as an excercise or source of some useful mixins.

#Do not try to use it as full Framework, there is no need! things like that exist! Dozens! Better!
